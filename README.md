## Introduction

The world surf journal is a web application that allows the user to register an account and save their surf trips with various details and rating. It was carried out over the course of three days and part of the final checkpoint while enrolled on a Web Development course at the Wild Code School. It is a fullstack application and consists of a frontend, backend and database.

The deployed version consists of a frontend, backend and database. It can be found at the following:

- `https://worldsurfjournal-production.up.railway.app/`

## Technologies

To develope the World Surf Journal fullstack application the following technologies were used:

 - Frontend
   - CSS, JavaScript, React
 - Backend
   - Node.js, Express
 - Database
   - MySQL

## Installation 

The project was created using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

It can be set-up by the following 

 - First:
    - ``` git clone ```
    - ``` git@github.com:Billy-Night/world_surf_journal.git ```

  - Second: 
    - ``` npm install ```

> This will install all the dependencies.
  - Third:
    - ``` npm start ```

> This will launch the frontend, but it still needs to be connected to the backend, which can be found at the following:
  - Fourth:
    - `git@github.com:Billy-Night/world_surf_journal_backend.git`

After this the backend will need to be connected to the database, the database script can be found within the backend folder as the following: `wsj_db.sql` .
